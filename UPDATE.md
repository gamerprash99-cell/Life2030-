# LifeOS — UPDATE

Change log for the `fix/audit-hardening` branch (UI/UX + navigation audit and redesign, 2026-09-17).

## What changed

### Navigation (root cause fix)
- **Before:** a global `BackHandler` in `LifeOSNavHost` intercepted every back press and popped to whatever the single NavController happened to be on. Combined with a flat route list, going Home → Notes and back could leave stale entries on the stack. Home → Notes → Home did not work via the UI.
- **After:** the global `BackHandler` is gone. The four primary destinations (Home, Tasks, Habits, Insights) live in one nested graph (`root_tabs`) with `saveState`/`restoreState`/`launchSingleTop` on bottom-bar taps. Child screens (Notes, Note Editor, Habit Detail, Expenses, Diary, Timeline, Capture Detail, Search, AI Assistant, Profile, Settings, App Lock Setup) are registered outside the graph, so they stack on top of the active tab and system Back dismisses them one level at a time.

### Bottom navigation (`LifeOSBottomBar.kt`)
- Order is now **Home, Tasks, Habits, Insights** (was Home, Habits, Tasks, Insights).
- Labels are **always visible** (previously the label only appeared for the selected item).
- Selected state: animated lavender pill (`secondaryContainer`) with primary icon+text; unselected: neutral `onSurfaceVariant` icon+label.
- 48dp minimum touch target, press-scale animation, tab semantics (`Role.Tab` + `selected`).
- Removed the dead legacy `LifeOSBottomBar(selected, onSelect)` overload from `LifeOSDesignComponents.kt`.

### Home screen (`HomeScreen.kt`)
- **Root-cause fix for the large empty gap:** the decorative gradient was a `Box(Modifier.size(210.dp))` that forced the greeting block to 210dp+; it now uses `matchParentSize()` behind real content.
- Rebuilt header (LifeOS • Today + date, search/settings/profile actions), greeting, Daily Momentum with animated progress, quick-action row, Today's Priorities, habits streak, Recent Activity, LifeOS Intelligence, and a Capture entry point.

### Insights screen (`InsightsScreen.kt`)
- Cognitive Vitality circular indicator is properly sized (was 104dp before, text overlapped the dial), with typography hierarchy and an honest empty state.
- Insight stat cards use a Column (icon/value/label) so values never overlap.
- Pattern Intelligence is clearly presented as the **local** engine; Weekly Narrative now renders its extracted score in a dedicated row ("N / 100").
- Added `internal fun narrativeScore(narrative): Int` that parses both `score N/100` and `N/100` formats (falls back to 0).

### Build hygiene
- `assembleDebug` passes; `testDebugUnitTest` passes (64 tests); `lintDebug` reports **0 errors**.
- Fixed pre-existing lint errors outside the redesign scope (no behavior change):
  - `NotificationHelper`: wrap `notify()` in `SecurityException` handling (Android 13+ permission race) and drop an obsolete `SDK_INT >= O` branch (minSdk is 26).
  - `AndroidManifest.xml`: declared `android.hardware.camera` as `required="false"` (camera works on camera-less/ChromeOS devices).
  - `VideoCaptureScreen`, `MediaPreviewUtils`, `HabitsScreen`, `TimelineScreen`: suppressed the `ProduceStateDoesNotAssignValue` false positives (the lambdas do assign `value`).
- New tests: `BottomNavItemsTest` (order/labels/route uniqueness) and `NarrativeScoreTest` (both score formats + fallbacks).

## Not changed
- All repositories, use cases, ViewModels, DAOs, entities and the Room schema.
- No internet permission, no cloud/AI/telemetry calls; everything remains offline-first.
- README.md and docs/ are preserved (README build-status and snapshot sections were updated).

## Verification
```text
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew :app:lintDebug
```

## Current source snapshot — 2026-09-17

This documentation set is aligned to the supplied LifeOS Android source snapshot. The source of truth is the Kotlin/Jetpack Compose implementation under `app/src/main/java/com/lifeos/app/`, together with `app/build.gradle.kts` and `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

### Verified architecture facts
- Native Kotlin Android application using Jetpack Compose + Material 3.
- Navigation uses Navigation Compose with a `root_tabs` nested graph for Home, Tasks, Habits and Insights; secondary screens remain stackable routes.
- Local persistence uses Room/SQLite with SQLCipher for database-at-rest encryption, plus DataStore for preferences/settings.
- Repositories and use cases remain the application data boundary; UI does not directly own Room access.
- Offline intelligence is implemented under `core/intelligence/` using deterministic local analyzers, rules, lexicons, statistics and templates.
- Capture uses CameraX for photo/video and Android `MediaRecorder` for audio, with runtime permissions requested only when capture is selected.
- Backup/restore is local and uses Android Storage Access Framework/document picker flows.
- App Lock is PIN-only (`NONE` / `PIN`) in the current source; no cloud identity or biometric App Lock implementation is present.
- The manifest does not declare `android.permission.INTERNET`.

### Verification boundary
The repository snapshot supplied for this documentation pass does not contain the Gradle wrapper scripts/JAR. Therefore this environment does not claim a fresh Gradle build, instrumentation run, or physical-device verification unless an executed command is recorded elsewhere in the project history.

### Maintenance rule
Historical sections are intentionally retained for traceability. When historical documentation conflicts with the current source, the current source and the latest dated current-state section take precedence; historical changelog entries should not be rewritten merely to make history appear current.


## Documentation synchronization — 2026-09-17

- Synchronized every Markdown document with the current supplied Kotlin/Compose source snapshot.
- Added a dated current-source section to all `.md` files without deleting historical documentation.
- Corrected the root README build-verification wording so it does not claim a fresh build from an environment where the Gradle wrapper is absent.
- Updated the roadmap/known-issues wording for current release-signing and verification state.
- Updated `docs/DOCUMENTATION_AUDIT.md` to the 2026-09-17 documentation state.
- No application source, Room schema, migrations, navigation implementation, or user data was changed by this documentation pass.
