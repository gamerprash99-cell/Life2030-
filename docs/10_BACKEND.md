# 10 — Backend / Server Architecture

## Current status

LifeOS has **no backend server**.

All core application data is stored locally using Room/SQLite. Preferences use DataStore. Intelligence is computed locally.

There is no required:

- cloud database
- REST API
- GraphQL service
- authentication server
- Firebase backend
- telemetry service
- external AI provider

## Offline-first behavior

Core features are designed to work without network access. Backup is a local JSON file operation; the user can explicitly export/share a backup using Android system capabilities.

## Architecture consequence

Do not add a server as a prerequisite for Notes, Tasks, Habits, Diary, Expenses, Timeline, Capture, App Lock or Intelligence. Future optional integrations must remain non-mandatory and must not silently upload user data.

## Current-state addendum — 2026-09-16

This document remains part of the LifeOS documentation set. Current UI/UX, motion, responsive and accessibility rules are centralized in [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md). The current Intelligence implementation is local/offline and requires no external AI provider or API key. Build/test statements are only considered verified when the exact command has been executed in a real Android/Gradle environment.

## Current implementation snapshot — 2026-09-16

LifeOS remains backend-free for core operation. No server, remote database, cloud AI or telemetry dependency was added.

## Current source snapshot — 2026-09-17

This documentation set is aligned to the supplied LifeOS Android source snapshot. The source of truth is the Kotlin/Jetpack Compose implementation under `app/src/main/java/com/lifeos/app/`, together with `app/build.gradle.kts` and `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

### Verified architecture facts
- Native Kotlin Android application using Jetpack Compose + Material 3.
- Navigation uses Navigation Compose with a `root_tabs` nested graph for Home, Tasks, Habits and Insights; secondary screens remain stackable routes.
- Local persistence uses Room/SQLite with SQLCipher for database-at-rest encryption, plus DataStore for preferences/settings.
- Repositories and use cases remain the application data boundary; UI does not directly own Room access.
- Offline intelligence is implemented under `core/intelligence/` using deterministic local analyzers, rules, lexicons, statistics and templates.
- Capture uses CameraX for photo/video and Android `MediaRecorder` for audio, with runtime permissions requested only when capture is selected.
- Backup/restore is local and uses Android Storage Access Framework/document picker flows.
- App Lock is PIN-only (`NONE` / `PIN`) in the current source; no cloud identity or biometric App Lock implementation is present.
- The manifest does not declare `android.permission.INTERNET`.

### Verification boundary
The repository snapshot supplied for this documentation pass does not contain the Gradle wrapper scripts/JAR. Therefore this environment does not claim a fresh Gradle build, instrumentation run, or physical-device verification unless an executed command is recorded elsewhere in the project history.

### Maintenance rule
Historical sections are intentionally retained for traceability. When historical documentation conflicts with the current source, the current source and the latest dated current-state section take precedence; historical changelog entries should not be rewritten merely to make history appear current.
